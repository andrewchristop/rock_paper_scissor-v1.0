# rock_paper_scissor
Simple/(beginner-friendly code) rock, paper, and scissor game created from scratch using python.
This program utilizes nested if-s and cascading if-s to check the validity of a move.
This program also uses lists in order to store anticipated relevant responses regarding a move a player/computer will make.
I apologize if the code comes off a bit messy, as this is my first attempt at a mini-project.

Code is created by scratch by Christopher Andrew
